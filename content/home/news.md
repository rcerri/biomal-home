### [01/02/2021 - New research project approved!](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/auxilios/107677/identification-of-snps-and-genes-related-to-grain-yield-in-rice-using-machine-learning/)

Our group just had a research project approved with a grant from FAPESP. The project will investigate Machine Learning methods for the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the production of rice grains. This is a project in collaboration with [Embrapa Rice and Beans](https://www.embrapa.br/en/arroz-e-feijao).
