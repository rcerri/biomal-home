Access [HERE](http://www.biomal.ufscar.br/somStreamML.html) source code and datasets from our contribution [(Cerri et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3412841.3441922) presented in the [36th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (2021)](https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2021/index.html).\
In this contribution, we propose an online unsupervised incremental method based on self-organizing maps for multi-label stream classification in scenarios with infinitely delayed labels.
